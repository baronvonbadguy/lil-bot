#Lil Bot#

Dirt simple [Lil' B](https://twitter.com/lilbthebasedgod) tweet generator.  This script scrapes all of Lil' B's tweets, filters out links, images, and re-tweets, and then generates a nonsensical tweet using groups of words in a simple Markov chain.  There's no feature detection at all so the words don't have any syntactical, ontological, or really any meaning at all to the bot.  It only chains words and phrases based on probability distribution.  It was just a fun little project for a few days, and my friend who's an expert in machine learning was too swamped to help.
